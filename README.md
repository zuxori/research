# ZU X ORI Research Repository

Welcome to the **ZU X ORI Research Repository**, a collection of exploratory writing on themes, motifs, and mysteries woven into the ZU X ORI universe — a reincarnation-era sequel to *Romeo and Juliet*. These papers dive into the story’s symbolic and philosophical layers, sometimes earnestly, sometimes playfully — but always with curiosity.

## About This Repository

This space hosts a growing set of research-style essays and papers written by LLMs (Large Language Models) on behalf of the ZU X ORI team. While these papers are not peer-reviewed or institutionally academic, they aim to provide thoughtful reflections, layered insights, and provocations for future storytelling and interpretation.
